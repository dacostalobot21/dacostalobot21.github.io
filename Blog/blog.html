                       <h2>
                         Student Life at SPP
                       </h2>
                       <p>
                         Being a student at Saint Peter's Prep, I am expected to be involved one way or another. Besides academic perfection (something I strive for daily),<br>
                         I love to practice music (concert band and choir), historical knowledge (history bowl club), chess club, and I'm thinking about now joining the coding club!<br>
                         As a scholar, many expect me to have an overwhelming workload of difficult classes, and I'll admit, it's going to be very difficult. My classes include<br>
                         AP World History, Honors Pre-Calculus, Honors English II, Honors Chemistry, Honors Latin II, Spanish I, and The New Testament (sophomore religion course).
                       </p>
                       <h2>
                         Life Outside of School 
                       </h2>
                       <p>
                         Although I am greatly involved at SPP (as all should be, I believe), I'm also rather involved in my hometown of Nutley, New Jersey.<br>
                         One hobby of mine is, as mentioned before, music, and at the moment, I am part of Marching Band for Nutley. Soon, when November hits,<br>
                         I look to be part of Nutley's Indoor Percussion Ensemble, as I have been for the past two years. At home, I enjoy swimming very much<br>
                         (I'm blessed to own a pool at home), as well as reading, video game playing, and yet more music whenever I'm bored!
                       </p>
                       <h2>
                         Video Games
                       </h2>
                       <p>
                         I absolutely love video games. What kind of American teenager doesn't at least go on his or her phone multiple times a day?<br>
                         Some of my favorite games include Rocket League, Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Portal, and many more! I prefer to play on console (Xbox One),<br>
                         but I will play on PC as well.
                       </p>

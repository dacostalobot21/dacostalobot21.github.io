      <h2>
        Cookies
      </h2>
      <p>
        My personal website does not utilize cookies, as it is not quite an official site yet.<br>
        If this site ever grows, be sure to expect cookies, however! I find them quite intriguing. And tasty.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Overall Privacy
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every time my website is accessed, either by a moderator, visitor, or even myself, every input is logged,<br>
        so don't try to be sneaky! Nah, I'm just kidding. Besides, why would you want to do something sneaky on this site?
      </p>
      <h2>
        Log-ons
      </h2>
      <p>
        Personally, I don't mind logging in to a website I use everyday, even though my student e-mail is quite long!<br>
        I believe security is necessary for everything, even if risk is low, such as "Google Classroom."<br>
        I have had some trouble with security before, as well as some close relatives. No need to let someone else have those problems, right?
      </p>
      <p class="redback">
        Always keep yourself locked down and secure!
